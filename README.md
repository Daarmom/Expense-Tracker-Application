# Expense-Tracker-Application

This is a Python-based expense tracker application designed to help users track their daily expenses.
The app uses Object-Oriented Programming principles and CSV files for data storage.

1. Add Expense class:
   -- To encapsulate all information related to a single expense, such as amount, date, category, and description.
   -- This class provides a structured way to manage individual expense entries as objects, making it easier to handle and store data consistently.
2. Add Category class:
   -- To categorize expenses and make it easier to organize and filter them based on spending types
   -- Each Category object can represent a unique category, allowing easy grouping and reporting by category.
